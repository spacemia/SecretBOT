SecretBOT is not an opensourced BOT, this was developed by the following people:
@excelcord
@spacemiaa

It does NOT use an prefix, just PING the bot and it will reply to your message (it will not always reply as it is being used in many servers.) Example:
Hey @SecretBOT
- Reply Hello! What can I help you with?

If the ping @SecretBOT does not work, try @secretaccountrweelxd
No, SecretBOT is not controlled by the developers, it uses OPENAI.
